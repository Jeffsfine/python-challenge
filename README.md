# Python challenges! 
Includes two separate challenges.
Pybank, and PyPoll.

## PyBank
Pybank looks through financial data to extract the following:
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
And uses that data to calculate: 
    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, 
    - The average of those changes
    -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    -The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
## PyPoll
