# Python challenges! 
Includes two separate challenges.
Pybank, and PyPoll.

## PyBank
Pybank analyzes a company's financial data to extract:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  
And uses that data to calculate: 
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, 
- The average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
## PyPoll
PyPoll analyzes election data of a small town and calculates:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

The script also prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
